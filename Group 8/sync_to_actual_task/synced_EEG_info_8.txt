task_cutoff_EEG_data_8.mat contains EEG streams from Group 8. It is an N x 32 matrix. 

N rows are the greatest number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. There are N/A values for streams that do not reach N timestamps. 

32 columns are subset as follows
- The first 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab1"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab2"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_Laptop"
- The last 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_LabPC"

Each 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1731941662.689
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1731945278.977

For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab1, start cutoff index is 43907 and end cutoff index is 947979
For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab2, start cutoff index is 33863 and end cutoff index is 937935
For EEG Stream Unicorn_CSL_Laptop, start cutoff index is 38852 and end cutoff index is 942924
For EEG Stream Unicorn_CSL_LabPC, start cutoff index is 39338 and end cutoff index is 943410
