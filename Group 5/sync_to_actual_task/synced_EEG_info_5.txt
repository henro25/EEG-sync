There are three N x 8 matrices representing EEG stream for Group 5. 

N is the number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. The 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1730469121.993
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1730472641.084

Notes:

1. Unicorn_CSL_LabPC is not available. There were only 3 participants in Group 5.
2. Unicorn_HCILab2's stream seems to be cut off slightly early.
