There are four N x 8 matrices representing EEG stream for Group 2. 

N is the number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. The 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1727877596.924
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1727881197.157

Notes: 

1. Unicorn_CSL_LabPC was manually cut off since its corresponding OBS stream, OBS_CSL_LabPC, was not recorded.
