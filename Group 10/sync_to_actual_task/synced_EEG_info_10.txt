There are three N x 8 matrices representing EEG stream for Group 10. 

N is the number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. The 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1736520530.715
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1736524149.315

Note: 

1. Unicorn_CSL_LabPC's stream was not recorded. 
2. Unicorn_HCILab2's stream appears to have been cut off before the end of the task.
