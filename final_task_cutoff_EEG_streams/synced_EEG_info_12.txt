padded_task_cutoff_EEG_data_12.mat contains EEG streams from Group 12. It is an N x 24 matrix. 

N rows are the greatest number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. There are N/A values for streams that do not reach N timestamps. 

24 columns are subset as follows
- The first 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab1"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab2"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_Laptop"

Each 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

Note: 

1. OBS_CSL_LabPC and Unicorn_CSL_LabPC stream was not recorded. 
2. Unicorn_CSL_Laptop's stream seems to have not properly recorded data.

For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab1, start cutoff index is 2000 and end cutoff index is 901042
For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab2, start cutoff index is 2000 and end cutoff index is 901042
For EEG Stream Unicorn_CSL_Laptop, start cutoff index is 2000 and end cutoff index is 901042
