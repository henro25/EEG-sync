padded_task_cutoff_EEG_data_1.mat contains EEG streams from Group 1. It is an N x 32 matrix. 

N rows are the greatest number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. There are N/A values for streams that do not reach N timestamps. 

32 columns are subset as follows
- The first 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab1"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab2"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_Laptop"
- The last 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_LabPC"

Each 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

Notes: 

1. Unicorn_CSL_LabPC was manually cut off since its corresponding OBS stream, OBS_CSL_LabPC, died before the last OBS stream began.
2. Unicorn_HCILab2 Stream appears to have been slightly cut off.

For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab1, start cutoff index is 9000 and end cutoff index is 902300
For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab2, start cutoff index is 9000 and end cutoff index is 785670
For EEG Stream Unicorn_CSL_Laptop, start cutoff index is 9000 and end cutoff index is 902300
For EEG Stream Unicorn_CSL_LabPC, start cutoff index is 9000 and end cutoff index is 911300
