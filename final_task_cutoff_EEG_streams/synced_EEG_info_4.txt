padded_task_cutoff_EEG_data_4.mat contains EEG streams from Group 4. It is an N x 32 matrix. 

N rows are the greatest number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. There are N/A values for streams that do not reach N timestamps. 

32 columns are subset as follows
- The first 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab1"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab2"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_Laptop"
- The last 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_LabPC"

Each 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

Note:

1. Unicorn_HCILab2 stream appears to have been slightly cut off.

For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab1, start cutoff index is 5947 and end cutoff index is 909364
For EEG Stream Unicorn_HCILab2, start cutoff index is 9000 and end cutoff index is 761995
For EEG Stream Unicorn_CSL_Laptop, start cutoff index is 2433 and end cutoff index is 905850
For EEG Stream Unicorn_CSL_LabPC, start cutoff index is 9000 and end cutoff index is 912417
