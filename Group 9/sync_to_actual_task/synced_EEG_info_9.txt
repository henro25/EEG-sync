task_cutoff_EEG_data_9.mat contains EEG streams from Group 9. It is an N x 24 matrix. 

N rows are the greatest number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. There are N/A values for streams that do not reach N timestamps. 

24 columns are subset as follows
- The first 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab1"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab2"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_Laptop"

Each 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1734101194.152
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1734104714.052

Note: 

1. OBS_CSL_LabPC and Unicorn_CSL_LabPC stream was not recorded.
2. Unicorn_CSL_Laptop's stream seems to have not properly recorded data.
