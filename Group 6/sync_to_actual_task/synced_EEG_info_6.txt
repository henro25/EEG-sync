There are four N x 8 matrices representing EEG stream for Group 6. 

N is the number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. The 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1731076647.970
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1731080278.120

Note:

1. Unicorn_HCILab2's stream appears to be cut off before the end of the actual task.
