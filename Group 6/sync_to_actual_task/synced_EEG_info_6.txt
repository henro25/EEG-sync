synced_EEG_data_6 contains EEG streams from Group 6. It is an N x 32 matrix. 

N rows are the greatest number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. There are N/A values for streams that do not reach N timestamps. 

32 columns are subset as follows
- The first 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab1"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab2"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_Laptop"
- The last 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_LabPC"

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1731076647.970
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1731080278.120

Note: Unicorn_HCILab2's stream appears to be cut off before the end of the actual task.


The channel labels for each stream are:

- Fz
- C3
- Cz
- C4
- Pz
- PO7
- Oz
- PO8

Explicitly, in synced_EEG_data_6.mat, 

Row 0 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Fz channel,
Row 1 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's C3 channel,
Row 2 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Cz channel,
Row 3 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's C4 channel,
Row 4 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Pz channel,
Row 5 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's P07 channel,
Row 6 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Oz channel,
Row 7 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's POB channel,
Row 8 contains Unicorn_HCILab2's Fz channel,
Row 9 contains Unicorn_HCILab2's C3 channel,
and so on...
