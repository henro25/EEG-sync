synced_EEG_data_1 contains EEG streams from Group 1. It is an N x 32 matrix. 

N rows are the greatest number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. There are N/A values for streams that do not reach N timestamps. 

32 columns are subset as follows
- The first 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab1"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_HCILab2"
- The next 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_Laptop"
- The last 8 are from "Unicorn_CSL_LabPC"

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1727792156.738
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1727795730.971

Note: 

1. Unicorn_CSL_LabPC was manually cut off since its corresponding OBS stream, OBS_CSL_LabPC, died before the last OBS stream began.

2. Unicorn_HCILab2 Stream warning of: Calculated effective sampling rate 215.7338 Hz is different from specified rate 250.0000 Hz was indeed true (that I missed the first time around) as it leads to this stream (indicies 8 - 15 of the combined EEG stream) looking like it is cut off when it really isnâ€™t, it just has fewer frames per second. Specifically, 250 / 215.7338 = 1.15883556494 times less observations per second.

The channel labels for each stream are:

- Fz
- C3
- Cz
- C4
- Pz
- PO7
- Oz
- PO8

Explicitly, in synced_EEG_data_1.mat, 

Row 0 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Fz channel,
Row 1 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's C3 channel,
Row 2 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Cz channel,
Row 3 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's C4 channel,
Row 4 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Pz channel,
Row 5 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's P07 channel,
Row 6 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's Oz channel,
Row 7 contains Unicorn_HCILab1's POB channel,
Row 8 contains Unicorn_HCILab2's Fz channel,
Row 9 contains Unicorn_HCILab2's C3 channel,
and so on...
