There are four N x 8 matrices representing EEG stream for Group 1. 

N is the number of timestamps that an EEG stream encompasses. The 8 columns correspond to channel labels: Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, PO7, Oz, and PO8, in that order.

All EEG streams start at UNIX time: 1727792156.738
All EEG streams end at UNIX time:   1727795730.971

Notes: 

1. Unicorn_CSL_LabPC was manually cut off since its corresponding OBS stream, OBS_CSL_LabPC, died before the last OBS stream began.
2. Unicorn_HCILab2 Stream appears to have been slightly cut off.
